// We use the let keyword for variables which hold values that can be changed.
// The const keyword is for values that can not be changed.

// If you tried to reassign the constant, then when you run it, 
// JavaScript would throw an error saying 'TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.'

// May sometimes see constants named with the snake_case naming convention
// depending on the naming convention of your development team.

// Also may see variables named with snake_case with the letters capitalized.
const COLOR_GREEN = 'green';

// Regardless of the naming convention, it's best to use descriptive names for your variables.
