// Objects are a way to store key-value pairs.
// They allow us to group together stat and behavior that's highly related.
// The benefit is we can make our code cohesive and organized.

// Encapsulation involves grouping together data and the methods that 
// manipulate that data into a single unit.
// While hiding or abstracting away the internal details from outside interference or misuse.
