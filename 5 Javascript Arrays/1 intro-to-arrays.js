// Arrays are a commonly used data structure.
// Arrays provide a collection of elements (a list of items).

// In JavaScript arrays, the index position stores an element that can be of any data type.
// However in real applications, all elements of an array are usually of the same data type.

// There are many built in methods for arrays, which enable you 
// to modify, filter, and retrieve data, using clean and modern syntax.
